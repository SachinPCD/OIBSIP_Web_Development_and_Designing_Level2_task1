# Oasis Infobyte Internship Task  
### Advanced Calculator Implementation

***

## Project Overview

This repository presents an **Advanced Calculator** built as a showcase for the Oasis Infobyte "Web Development and Designing" internship task. The calculator delivers a modern, intuitive interface with support for core mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division—as well as advanced features like percentage, parentheses, square, and square root calculations.  
All components are crafted with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, following responsive and professional UI/UX principles.

***

##  Technologies & Tools Used

- **HTML5**  
  Defines the calculator's structural layout—including display, buttons, and screen segmentation.
- **CSS3**  
  - Implements grid alignment for calculator buttons for organized visual appeal.  
  - Utilizes linear gradients, rounded corners, and box shadows for a sleek, professional aesthetic.  
  - Ensures responsive and accessible design for all devices.
- **JavaScript ES6**  
  - Handles interactive functionalities (`eventListeners`, `if-else` statements, operators, loops).
  - Governs dynamic display updates, button event handling, and mathematical logic.
  - Employs the `eval()` function (with error handling) to parse and compute user expressions.

##  Key Features

- **Interactive Display & Buttons**  
  - Real-time input feedback and results rendering.
  - Grid-based button arrangement for intuitive access.
- **Basic & Advanced Operations**  
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
  - Supports `%`, parentheses `()`, square `x²`, and square root `√`.
- **User Experience**  
  - Animated button press effects.
  - Responsive screen layout and clear expression/result separation.
  - Accessible, readable font and color choices.
- **Operational Safety**  
  - Built-in error handling for invalid inputs.
  - "Delete" and "Answer" functionalities for input correction and reuse.

##  How I Built It

1. **Structured HTML**:  
   - Designed a compact calculator container with screen and button sections.
   - Integrated an accessible font via Google Fonts for enhanced readability.

2. **Modern CSS Design**:  
   - Crafted a gradient background and soft button tones.
   - Utilized grid layouts to ensure precise and adaptive button placement.

3. **Functional JavaScript Logic**:  
   - Managed user input through button click event handlers.
   - Implemented mathematical operations using JavaScript logic and control structures.
   - Added special functions for square, square root, answer recall, and input deletion.

##  What I Learned

- **Efficient UI/UX Principles**  
  - How to design user-friendly interfaces using modern CSS techniques and grid systems.
- **JavaScript Event Handling**  
  - Attaching and managing event listeners for real-time interactivity.
  - Safely using `eval()` with validation for dynamic calculations.
- **Responsive & Accessible Design**  
  - Ensuring the calculator works smoothly on various devices and screen sizes.
  - Importance of color contrast, button size, and font selection for usability.
- **Robust Error Handling**  
  - Preventing code and logic errors for enhanced user experience.

##  Implementation Details

- All code is contained in:
  - `index.html` — Main structure and script.
  - `index.css` — Stylesheet for design and alignment.
- The project is **standalone**, requiring no external libraries besides Google Fonts.
- Follows **best practices** for code organization, readability, and maintainability.

##  Live Experience

- Open `index.html` in any browser to instantly interact with the advanced calculator UI—designed to reflect professional standards and ease-of-use.
